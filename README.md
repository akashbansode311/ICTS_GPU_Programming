# 🚀 CUDA Code Examples

This repository contains simple and practical CUDA C programs to help beginners and researchers understand the basics of **GPU programming with CUDA**.

## 📌 Requirements

* NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support
* CUDA Toolkit installed (e.g., 11.x or later)
* C/C++ compiler (e.g., `gcc`, `g++`)

## ▶️ How to Compile & Run

Example :

```bash
nvcc 01.Hello_World.cu -o Hello_World
./Hello_World
```

## 📚 Learning Goals

* Understand CUDA threads, blocks, and grids
* Learn memory hierarchy (global, shared, registers)
* Practice performance optimization with CUDA


This repository shows how CUDA accelerates real-world scientific computations.
